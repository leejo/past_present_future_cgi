This talk aims to give an overview of the past, present, and future
of the CGI.pm module.

As the new primary maintainer of CGI.pm i would like to explain what
i plan to do with the module, i would also like to bring people up
to speed with recent changes related to CGI.pm - especially the fact
that it will soon no longer be a core module.

I will also point out the state of the module with regards to issues
and highlight that it is still a commonly used module in some perl
development shops; that there are still some perl developers who will
advocate its use and why they shouldn't, with a heavy nod towards
Sawyer's recent "CGI.pm must die" talk.

The "future" will include suggestions for refactoring the module once
existing issues have been addressed. These may include:

	+ Documentation to dissuade the use of CGI.pm
	+ Increasing test coverage
	+ Removal of duplicate functionality
	+ Replacing pre-re-invented wheels with CPAN equivalents
	+ Deprecation of HTML generation functions

The talk is planned as a lightning talk.
